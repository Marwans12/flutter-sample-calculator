# flutter-simple-calculator
A basic cross-platform calculator made using dart and the flutter framework that supports multiple concurrent calculation with free input, inspired by Desmos calculator.
The project makes use of the Provider package to manage state and provide data access to different levels of the tree and manage the state. The Expressions package is used to evaluate mathematical expressions. The project objective was to understand the overall workings of flutter and
an attempt to make a calculator by means of looking up things as required.
